      <h1>The Idea Behind This Example</h1>
      <p>
        A demonstration GraphQL API and React client. Facebook's reference
        implementation of GraphQL is used on the server and Apollo for the
        client. The solution aims to address many of the concerns developers
        will face when starting out building GraphQL APIs. It also showcases
        many of the key new features of GraphQL such as Subscriptions and
        Persistent Queries.
